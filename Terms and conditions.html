  Failure to pay on time may result in cancellation of services without refund.</p>
  <h2> Permits & Approvals</h2>
  <p>The client is responsible for obtaining all necessary permits, permissions, or licenses required for a fireworks display.
   AKEvents can assist with the application process upon request, but final responsibility lies with the client.

    The site must meet legal safety distances as per local regulations.
    A site inspection may be required in advance.</p>
    <h2>Weather & Safety</h2>
    <p>Displays are weather-dependent. In the case of severe weather (e.g., high winds or lightning), AKEvents reserves the right to postpone or cancel the display for safety reasons.
If the event is canceled due to weather, AKEvents will make reasonable efforts to reschedule. Refunds are not guaranteed.
On-site safety is managed by trained professionals; no unauthorized persons may enter the firing zone.</p>
<h2>Cancellations & Refunds</h2>
<p>Cancellations must be made in writing.
The deposit is non-refundable under any circumstances.
If cancellation occurs less than 14 days before the event, the full fee is payable.</p>
